            Your closet should be a sanctuary of organization, not a source of daily stress. Whether you're dealing with 
            overflowing shelves, tangled hangers, or simply can't find anything when you need it, the question inevitably 
            arises: should you tackle this project yourself or bring in the professionals?

            The DIY Closet Approach: Pros and Cons
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
            Advantages of DIY Closet Organization
          </h3>
          
          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-6 mb-6">
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Cost Savings</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The most obvious benefit is budget control. DIY closet systems from big box stores typically cost 
              $200-$800, compared to $1,500-$5,000 for professional custom solutions. For budget-conscious homeowners 
              in Seattle's competitive housing market, this difference can be significant.
            </p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Complete Creative Control</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              You know your belongings better than anyone. DIY allows you to customize every detail according to 
              your specific needs, from the height of shelves to the placement of accessory drawers.
            </p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Flexible Timeline</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Work at your own pace, on weekends, or whenever inspiration strikes. No need to coordinate with 
              contractors or wait for installation appointments.
            </p>

            Challenges of DIY Closet Projects

            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-800 mb-3">Time Investment</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              What seems like a weekend project often stretches into weeks. Planning, shopping, measuring, 
              cutting, and installing can easily consume 20-40 hours of your time.
            </p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-800 mb-3">Skill Requirements</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Modern closet systems require precision measuring, level installation, and often involve electrical 
              work for lighting. Mistakes can be costly and frustrating to fix.
            </p>
            
            <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-800 mb-3">Limited Customization</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Off-the-shelf systems work for standard spaces, but Seattle homes often feature unique architectural 
              elements, sloped ceilings, or unusual dimensions that challenge pre-made solutions.

                Professional installations typically include warranties and ongoing support. If something

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Whether DIY or professional, accurate measurements are crucial. Seattle homes often have 
                unique quirks ‚Äì that "standard" closet might have a sloped ceiling or offset wall that 
                affects your design.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Seattle's climate means seasonal clothing storage is essential. Plan for bulky winter coats, 
                rain gear, and outdoor equipment that many other regions don't require.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Pacific Northwest homes can be naturally darker. Good closet lighting is essential for 
                functionality, whether you install battery-operated LED strips or have an electrician 
                add proper fixtures.

            The Bottom Line: Making Your Decision

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            There's no universally right answer to the DIY vs. professional closet debate. The best choice 
            depends on your budget, timeline, skill level, and long-term goals for your home. What matters 
            most is creating a functional, organized space that serves your daily needs and brings you joy 
            every time you open those doors.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Remember that closet organization is an investment in your daily quality of life. Whether you 
            choose to DIY or work with professionals, the time and money spent creating an organized, 
            functional space will pay dividends in reduced stress, saved time, and increased home satisfaction.
