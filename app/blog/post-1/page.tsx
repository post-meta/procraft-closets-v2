                1. Prioritize Weather-Specific Storage Solutions
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Seattle's rainy climate means you need dedicated space for rain jackets, umbrellas, and waterproof gear. 
                Install hooks near your closet entrance for quick access to rain coats, and consider a designated cubby 
                for wet umbrellas with a drip tray underneath.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4">
                <li>Add ventilated storage for damp outdoor gear</li>

                2. Maximize Vertical Space in Smaller Seattle Homes
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Many Seattle homes, especially in neighborhoods like Queen Anne and Fremont, feature smaller bedrooms 
                with limited closet space. The key is thinking vertically and using every inch from floor to ceiling.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4">
                <li>Install double-hang rods to double your hanging space</li>
                <li>Use stackable storage bins on upper shelves</li>
                <li>Add over-door organizers for accessories and small items</li>
                <li>Consider ceiling-mounted storage for seasonal items</li>

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                With Seattle's booming tech industry, many residents need organized spaces for both casual and 
                business-casual attire. Design your closet to support your professional lifestyle while maintaining 
                the Pacific Northwest's relaxed aesthetic.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4">
                <li>Dedicate hanging space for blazers and dress shirts</li>

                4. Implement Moisture Control Systems
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Seattle's humidity can create problems in enclosed spaces. Protecting your clothing and accessories 
                from moisture damage is crucial for maintaining your wardrobe investment.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4">

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Seattle's mild but varied seasons require flexible storage solutions. Create a system that allows 
                easy rotation between summer hiking gear and winter rain protection.

                6. Incorporate Sustainable Organization Solutions
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Seattleites value sustainability, and your closet organization should reflect these values. 
                Choose eco-friendly materials and create systems that encourage clothing longevity and reuse.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                From hiking the Cascades to biking the Burke-Gilman Trail, Seattle residents are active. Your closet 
                should accommodate athletic wear, outdoor gear, and the quick transitions between activities.

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4">

                8. Utilize Smart Lighting Solutions
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Seattle's frequent overcast days mean your closet needs excellent lighting to help you choose 
                outfits and maintain organization. Poor lighting leads to poor clothing choices and disorganization.

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4">

                <li>Consider a full-spectrum light for color accuracy</li>

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Seattle's dynamic job market and lifestyle mean your storage needs may change. Design your closet 
                with flexibility in mind to adapt to new careers, hobbies, or living situations.
