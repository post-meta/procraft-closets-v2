        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-6">Expert Closet Organization Tips for Seattle Living</h2>
          
          {/* Tip 1 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">1. Maximize Vertical Space with Custom Shelving</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Seattle homes often feature unique architectural elements but limited closet space. Make every inch count by installing floor-to-ceiling custom shelving systems. Utilize the often-wasted space above your highest hanging rod by adding shelves for seasonal items, luggage, or rarely-used belongings.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Install adjustable shelving systems that can adapt as your storage needs change. This flexibility is especially valuable in Seattle's dynamic housing market where residents frequently relocate.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 2 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">2. Combat Seattle's Humidity with Proper Ventilation</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              The Pacific Northwest's moist climate can wreak havoc on clothing and accessories stored in poorly ventilated closets. Prevent mold, mildew, and musty odors by ensuring proper air circulation throughout your closet space.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Install ventilation fans in walk-in closets, use moisture absorbers, and consider cedar elements which naturally repel moisture and insects. Avoid storing damp clothing, especially rain gear, without proper drying first.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 3 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">3. Create Dedicated Zones for Seattle's Multi-Season Wardrobe</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Seattle's unpredictable weather means you need quick access to everything from summer shorts to winter rain gear – sometimes on the same day! Organize your closet into distinct zones: everyday wear, professional attire, outdoor gear, and seasonal items.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Keep transitional pieces like light sweaters and waterproof jackets in easily accessible areas. Store heavy winter coats and summer-only items in higher or lower sections during off-seasons.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 4 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">4. Invest in Quality Hangers for Longevity</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Ditch the wire hangers and invest in quality wooden or velvet hangers that maintain garment shape and prevent slipping. For Seattle's professional workforce, this investment pays dividends in maintaining the appearance of business attire.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Use specialty hangers for specific items: padded hangers for delicate blouses, suit hangers for jackets, and clips hangers for pants. Consistent hanger types also create a cleaner, more organized appearance.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 5 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">5. Implement the "One In, One Out" Rule</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              With Seattle's limited closet space, maintaining organization requires discipline. For every new item you bring into your closet, remove one item that no longer serves you. This practice prevents accumulation and keeps your space manageable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Consider Seattle's excellent donation infrastructure – organizations like Goodwill, The Salvation Army, and local shelters make it easy to give your gently used items a second life while supporting the community.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 6 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">6. Optimize Lighting for Seattle's Gray Days</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Seattle's famously overcast skies mean your closet needs excellent artificial lighting. Poor lighting makes it difficult to coordinate outfits and can lead to purchasing duplicate items unnecessarily.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Install LED strip lighting along shelves and hanging rods, and consider battery-operated puck lights for deep shelves. Motion-sensor lights add convenience while conserving energy – perfect for environmentally-conscious Seattle residents.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 7 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-pink-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">7. Utilize Door Space for Maximum Efficiency</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Don't overlook the back of your closet door – this prime real estate can house shoes, accessories, ties, or cleaning supplies. Over-the-door organizers are particularly valuable in Seattle's smaller homes and apartments.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Install hooks for bags, robes, or tomorrow's outfit. Use clear shoe organizers for small accessories, scarves, or even outdoor gear like gloves and beanies that Seattle residents use year-round.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 8 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-teal-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">8. Store Seasonal Items Strategically</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Seattle's mild climate means you'll need access to various seasonal items throughout the year, but you don't need everything at arm's reach. Store heavy coats, boots, and winter gear in upper shelves during summer months.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Use clear, labeled bins for seasonal rotation. Keep a few transitional pieces accessible year-round since Seattle weather can be unpredictable – you might need a light jacket in July!
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 9 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-orange-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">9. Incorporate Seattle-Specific Storage Solutions</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Design your closet with Seattle living in mind. Create designated spaces for rain gear, hiking equipment, and the layers that are essential for Pacific Northwest weather. Consider installing hooks specifically for wet umbrellas and rain coats.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              If you're an outdoor enthusiast (like many Seattleites), dedicate a section to active wear and gear. Use bins or baskets to organize hiking socks, base layers, and seasonal outdoor accessories.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Tip 10 */}
          <div className="mb-8 border-l-4 border-cyan-500 pl-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">10. Regular Maintenance and Seasonal Reviews</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Set a schedule to review and reorganize your closet seasonally. Seattle's changing seasons provide natural transition points to assess what's working, what needs adjustment, and what items should be donated or stored elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Perform monthly mini-cleanouts, checking for items that have migrated from their designated spots. This small investment of time prevents major reorganization projects and keeps your system functioning smoothly.
